Forest
the trees sway in the cool breese, the leaves are heavy with snow.

Clearing
you find yourself in a clearing, the snow is thick but you can easily see the giant moon overhead.

Forest with River
you stumbled into a river in this forest, it is flowing slowly and calmly down the hill. you see a single tree fallen across the river.

Crashed Ship
This ship seems to be old, maybe it crashed here the same way you did. it seems to have an opening in the hull from the crash landing.

Plains
these plains are covered in a thick layer of snow, you wonder how anything manages to grow or survive here.

Lake
the water is cold, what could be lurking in its depths.

Mountain
the height of this mountain is staggering. you arent normally one to be afraid of heights, you are a pilot after all but normally you are strapped in with a parachute if something goes wrong.

Dead Forest
this poor forest hasnt seemed to be able to stay alive in this harsh environment. the branches are bare and you can very easily see through the forest.

River
this part of the river seems to be flowing quite fast. you wonder if there is any unfortunate wildlife in the waters.

Small Mountain
this is more of a large hill but its the only high ground, you wonder if this may have been a much larger mountain before. after all, a closer moon means flooding.

Mountain With Door
you see an unusual looking square on the side of this mountain. it seems to be a door to some sort of facility. maybe it has some parts for your hyperdrive.
